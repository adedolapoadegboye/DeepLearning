The positional parameters are identified by their position in the sequence of parameters. The key-word parameters are identified by their name. Key-word parameters come with a default value, so you do not have to always pass it as an input when calling the function. See the example below with two 2 positional and 1 key-word parameters."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"oltXXIdtBPEy"},"source":["def sum2( x, y, squared=False):\n","    if squared:\n","        s = (x + y)**2\n","    else:\n","        s = (x + y)\n","    return s"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3kHkCIPTBPEz"},"source":["See examples of the function calling:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ikJneaa4BPEz","outputId":"e47bca25-084e-4886-fe01-31314a0c8201"},"source":["print('sum2(2, 3):', sum2(2, 3)) \n","print('sum2(2, 3, False):', sum2(2, 3, False))\n","print('sum2(2, 3, True):', sum2(2, 3, True)) \n","print('sum2(2, 3, squared= True):', sum2(2, 3, squared= True)) "],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["sum2(2, 3): 5\n","sum2(2, 3, False): 5\n","sum2(2, 3, True): 25\n","sum2(2, 3, squared= True): 25\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lNEzhkqoBPE0"},"source":["## Where to learn Python?\n","\n","The best way to become a Python expert is by studying its documentation and examples.
